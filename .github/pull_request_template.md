When merging changes in the utils repository, the base image will need to be rebuilt, and then every other AMI after that.
This is to identify any issues that may crop up from making changes to utils (e.g., bumping package versions) early on.
If this is not done, it can obfuscate the origin of any potential issues that show up later.
